# Earthquake Data Engineering Pipeline with Microsoft Fabric

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for earthquake data using Microsoft Fabric. The pipeline processes earthquake data from the USGS API and employs the Medallion architecture to organize data into three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

## Project Architecture
The project utilizes a star schema model for the gold layer, ensuring optimized query performance and easy integration with Power BI.

The project utilizes the Medallion architecture, with data flowing from raw ingestion to business-ready insights. The architecture includes the following layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw data storage

Silver Layer: Data cleaning and transformation

Gold Layer: Business-ready data for visualization

## Project Structure

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from the USGS API. [usgs](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/)

Description: Stores raw earthquake data as ingested from the USGS API.

Data: Captures properties such as magnitude, location, and time of the earthquakes.

- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and enriched data.

Description: Cleans and transforms the raw data, adding contextual information such as geolocation details.

Data Transformations:

Converting epoch time to human-readable format

Categorizing magnitude into bins

- **Gold Layer**: business-ready data for visualization.

Description: Business-ready data stored in a star schema for analysis.

Schema:

Fact Table: Earthquake_Fact containing earthquake event details.

Dimension Tables:

Place_Dimension (Primary Key: place_id)

Magnitude_Category_Dimension (Primary Key: magCategory_id)

Time_Dimension (Primary Key: full_date)
